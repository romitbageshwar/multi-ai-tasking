## 📌 About the Project
AI Project Sync Space is a **multi-agent AI system** where:
- A **Project Manager AI** breaks down a project into smaller tasks.
- **Employee AIs** (Researcher, Writer, Editor) complete their assigned tasks.
- The Project Manager collects the results and produces a **final combined deliverable**.

✅ Runs fully online using **Streamlit + Hugging Face Spaces**.  
✅ Supports both **free Hugging Face models** and **optional OpenAI API key** for GPT.  
✅ Safe for public demos (no keys exposed).

## 🧩 Workflow

Here’s how the system works:

1. User enters a project description.  
2. Project Manager AI breaks it down into tasks.  
3. Tasks are assigned to Employee AIs:
   - Researcher → gathers insights.  
   - Writer → drafts structured content.  
   - Editor → polishes and refines.  
4. Project Manager combines all employee outputs into a **final deliverable**.  
5. User sees the entire process in the Streamlit dashboard.
